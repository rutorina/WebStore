## Technical Approach

### Challenge: Rozetka Anti-Bot Protection
Rozetka.com.ua implements anti-bot measures that block direct scraping attempts, returning 403 errors even with advanced headers and user-agent rotation.

### Solution: Pre-Verified Image URLs
Instead of real-time scraping, we used:
1. Manual research to find exact Rozetka product pages
2. Extraction of direct image URLs from these pages
3. Creation of a mapping system linking products to their exact images
4. Implementation of fallback mechanisms

### Image URL Pattern
Rozetka uses consistent URL patterns for high-quality images:
```
https://content.rozetka.com.ua/goods/images/big/{product_id}.jpg
https://content1.rozetka.com.ua/goods/images/big/{product_id}.jpg
https://content2.rozetka.com.ua/goods/images/big/{product_id}.jpg
```

## Usage

### Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
php update_exact_images.php
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Test single product
php fix_mapped_images.php single 1

# Preview mappings
php fix_mapped_images.php preview

# Verify current images
php fix_mapped_images.php verify

# Update all with enhanced service
php fix_exact_images.php all
```

### Verification
```bash
php list_products.php
```

## Benefits

1. **Exact Product Match**: Each image now shows the exact product being sold
2. **High Quality**: All images are high-resolution product photos from Rozetka
3. **Professional Appearance**: Official product images improve store credibility
4. **Consistent Source**: All images from the same trusted e-commerce platform

## Future Enhancements

2. **Image Validation**: Implement image accessibility checking
3. **Multiple Sources**: Add fallback to other Ukrainian e-commerce sites
4. **API Integration**: If Rozetka provides API access, integrate it
5. **Image Optimization**: Add image compression and CDN integration
